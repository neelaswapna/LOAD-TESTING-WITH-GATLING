##
  The above Gatling script is used for advanced load testing of a web application to evaluate its performance under simulated heavy traffic. It helps identify bottlenecks, slow response times, and failure rates before real users experience issues. Gatling uses Scala-based DSL to define test scenarios, making it highly scalable and efficient for performance testing.
  In real-time, this type of load testing is crucial for e-commerce websites, banking applications, streaming platforms, and SaaS products, where high user traffic can lead to performance degradation. For example, an e-commerce site must ensure its checkout system can handle thousands of concurrent users without delays. Similarly, a banking application should be able to support multiple secure transactions simultaneously.
  The tools used include Gatling, which provides an HTTP-based load testing framework, and Chrome Developer Tools (for analyzing network performance). Gatling generates detailed HTML reports showing response times, error rates, and throughput, which helps developers optimize server performance.
  By integrating Gatling with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), businesses can continuously monitor system performance and proactively fix performance issues, ensuring seamless user experience during peak loads.
